## 📝 Instructions

In this activity, we will work with the beebox virtual machine, which contains bWAPP, to exploit vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top 10. You will learn how to exploit **PHP Code Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Reflected** using the GET and POST methods. You should apply the same steps to the other vulnerabilities in the OWASP Top 10.
